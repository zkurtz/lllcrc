Title: Local Log-linear Models for Capture-Recapture
Version: 1.2

Description: Applies local log-linear capture-recapture models (LLLMs) for
    closed populations, as described in the doctoral thesis of Zachary Kurtz.
    The method is relevant when there are 3-5 capture occasions, with auxiliary
    covariates available for all capture occasions.  As part of estimating the
    number of missing population units, the method estimates the "rate of
    missingness" as it varies over the covariate space.  In addition,
    user-friendly functions are provided to recreate (approximately) the method
    of Zwane and van der Heijden (2004), which applied the VGAM package
    in a way that is closely related to LLLMs.
